<p>Lived Experiences Project</p>

 

           <p> My major is computer science and Engineering with an Economics specialization, and I have just been thinking about the kind of careers available for my major. The first time I was introduced to real programming was in my last year of high school, and it was the BASIC language. I wasn’t into it that much because it was basically like using a calculator but much faster and easier to keep track of everything. The major problem that I had is that it was all in English and I that weren’t very good at English at the time. I didn’t even know all English alphabets. However, I was more into learning about hacking, and first hacking tools I used were “sub7”, which allows hackers to take “virtually complete control” over any computer. Also, it used to amaze me how can people make a lot of money from online advertisement. So, I made many websites but there were all just taking codes from other websites and make it into one and then add ads. After that, I heard some people talking about getting free and fast internet from satellites .also, they can get some paid TV channels for free. I had success with getting TV channels but not the internet.  I faced problems with my family after they found out about what I used to do with the computer and took the computer away. That was last time I did anything like that , and this experience made me choose different kinds of

things to do in my free time such as working and establishing my own business exporting and importing and working on cars, auto parts, electronics, and machines.

After graduating from high school I went to King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals for one year, then, I got accepted on scholarship program to study at Michigan State University. I didn’t initially choose CSE as my major, and was thinking about changing it before I took my first class in CSE. It was because everyone I knew who was majoring in CSE changed their major right after taking their first CSE class. They told me it’s too hard. However, after taking that class and finding out how easy it was, I didn’t need to memorize anything; just understanding the idea and how to do things was good enough to get a good grade in that class, and also, I didn’t need even to study for the exams. All I had to do was review my class notes. So, at that point I didn’t even have a doubt about trying to change my major especially since I am not that great at memorizing exact word by word sentences.

<p>
Computer also inspired me to have Economics specialization and it started when I made a program about company data base so I decided to learn more about economics. I choose the specialization in Economics although I started taking first two economics classes as a part of the plan to choose business management or something like that. However, after studying Microeconomics and Macroeconomics, that was like something opened my eyes about a lot of things around me and how all those companies work. That made it more interesting for me because I used to work on trading and export and import before and I used to make a great income but there were many things I didn’t understand before, such as doing whole sale at the price of buying

or less just to buy new products. So, in each economics class I attended, I asked each professor about some problems that I used to face in the past while running my business; I got some answers about some problems. And that is one of the points to keep in mind about my career choice.
</p>


<p>

So as a career, I’m looking to get back to my own business instead of finding a job and working for a company. I think that would be much better for many reasons, for example, I used to do that before with less efficiency and now I could fix all that and make better income. However, capital and market reputation has to be built from start again because I stopped doing it while I’m here since school takes most of my time and I barely have time to do anything else.  Running a business requires a great time investment to be able to keep up with the updates and events since most of what I used to do is based on best delivery time and keep up with the news. Although, I tried to keep up with both business and school at the same time to get some extra cash and there are still many people I used to work with telling me to get back to business.
</p>

<p>
However, I think I might consider getting a job to be able to have a good start since capital is really important to be able to start, and I wouldn’t be able to come back as strong as should without a big capital to build a good reputation which gets everything moving and get new more costumers. So, by searching for job available and needed based in my major I found many of them here with average starting basic salary of $100000 which is really good especially in this economy. However, I’m not interested in working here for a long time because I feel I should be back to be close to my family since I have been away for almost 6 years now. Also, I cannot live in such cold weather

like this for medical reason. In the other hand, going back home is not the best idea to get a job to build a capital because average starting salary over there is around $30000 only. However, I’m not thinking about that as much as I used to before, I think it would be the best to focus on my school now instead of thinking about what will happen after a year, things always change and nothing stays still. And best idea for now is to order my priorities instead of trying to do everything at same time because then at the end nothing would be done at the best that can be.

 However, what I prefer and what I might consider due to the issue of location wise is still under process. It’s more since I’m still thinking about going back to my home town to be close to my family although there are only really few careers to choose with low income, or finding the best career and just go where it might takes me and what issues I might have if I choose any of the choices.
