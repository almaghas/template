			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>This project is intended to discuss about the first time GTA made a game and then go to each version of it until this new one which is called GTA5. 
And how in each one they made it looks different and addressed major concern about the idea of having guns around, and the type of mission the game address and how it shift to more about cars than just guns in san Anderson one. But that one was a major gang and territory controlling and how that can be seen in life in most major big cities with more organized crimes and mafia. 
But it shifted that after that especially in GTA4 and focused more into guns and how physical effect of that to make it more realistic than before. 
And then would look at GTA5 which just came out. And what are the differences it has and major scenario of the game looks like 
.
 
The main issue is that kids get attached to this kind of video games and making them thinks they actually can shoot guns as easy as it looks like in the game and get away with it without any parchment. Also, how guns are all over the places and almost anyone could get one. Also, I don’t mean small guns such as one for protection or hunting but it’s more like war guns like AK47 and bazooka . in addition, I have seen some people own a tank ( I have seen that in a storage area in East Lansing). So, I’m just wondering: what would anyone need to have something like that in East Lansing which is not in a war zone? 
Solution is really not easy to discuss for such an issue because of many reasons, mainly that government wouldn’t be able to take all kind of guns from people but leaving all that like this would be a major issue for the society and to keep people feel safer. So best solution that I think would be more effective is to take off all kind of war guns from everyone other than the military. 

That would make it easier to keep society safety and to avoid all kind of massive gun shooting all around the places to the point people start shooting each other for no apparent reason at all.
