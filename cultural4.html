			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>The main issue is that kids get attached to this kind of video games and making them thinks they actually can shoot guns as easy as it looks like in the game and get away with it without any parchment. Also, how guns are all over the places and almost anyone could get one. Also, I don’t mean small guns such as one for protection or hunting but it’s more like war guns like AK47 and bazooka . in addition, I have seen some people own a tank ( I have seen that in a storage area in East Lansing). So, I’m just wondering: what would anyone need to have something like that in East Lansing which is not in a war zone? </p>
